A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous), and may originate in the brain (primary) or spread from other body parts (secondary). The growth rate and location of the tumor affect nervous system functions. Treatment options vary based on the tumor type, size, and location.
